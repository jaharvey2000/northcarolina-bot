# North Carolina Mention Bot

## A bot that tells you when you mention North Carolina

This is a silly project that I'm doing for a bit. It's not meant to be serious.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate and set a discord token.

Set the IMAGE\_URL environment variable to wherever your copy of `nc_mentioned.png` is.

Profit.

### Usage

Say the words "north carolina", case insensitive.
