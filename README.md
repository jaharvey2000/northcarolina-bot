# Discord Wikipedia Nickname Setter

## A bot to give yourself random discord usernames based on Wikipedia articles :)

This is a silly project that I'm doing for a bit. It's not meant to be serious.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate and set a discord token.

Set the USER\_AGENT environment variable to your email (please follow Wikipedia's API guidelines! They're not strict.)

Profit.

### Bot Usage

`/nameme`: Query Wikipedia's API for a random page, then set your discord username as that page's title.
